# Graph Data Structure and Graph Search Algorithms

Graph class holds graph related data such as number of vertices, number of edges. 
One can add vertices and edges. Graph is undirected. It is implemented as adjasency list.

In GraphSearch, two kinds of shortest path search algorithms are implemented.

These classes are mainly used to solve HackeRank challenges. My HackerRank profile is
